Download the Data Expo 2009 data from the Harvard Dataverse and construct an
SQLite Database called airline2.db with the following tables:
1. ontime (with the data from 2000 to 2005 – including 2000 and 2005)
2. airports (with the data in airports.csv)
3. carriers (with the data in carriers.csv)
4. planes (with the data in plane-data.csv)

Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_3” that includes:
1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment and a reference to the Data Expo 2009 data, and the Harvard Dataverse [1 point]

2. a folder called “r_sql” with a R code for constructing the database (from the csvinputs) and replicating the queries in the practice quiz. 
The latter should be done both using DBI and dplyr notation [1.75 points each]

3. a folder called “python_sql” with a Python version of the code in point 2, based  on sqlite3 [1.75 points]

4. A simplified solution for the query in Q4 in either R or Python (placed either in the R or Python *_sql folder) [1.75 points]

Note that the database file should not be placed in the GitHub repository (it is quite large). Also, the R and Python scripts should save the output of the queries in csv within their respective folders [1 point each].
