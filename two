Practice assignment 2
Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_2” that includes:
1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment [1 point]
2. a folder called “r_csv” with a R code for scraping the CSV example on cars in the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values and
saving the resulting output in the local folder (in CSV) [4.5 points – module E]

3. a folder called “python_csv” with a Python version of the code in point 2 [4.5 points – module F]
Note that it is advised to use the packages rvest (R) and BeautifulSoup (Python) for scaping operations. RSelenium (R) and Selenium (Python) can also be used, but they are
generally more complicated to setup.
